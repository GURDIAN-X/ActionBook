### 2.3 GDPR COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

While MinuteHub primarily serves Tanzanian institutions, GDPR compliance is adopted as a best practice framework, particularly for:
- Potential international users
- Tanzanian institutions with EU partnerships
- Demonstrating commitment to highest data protection standards

**Key GDPR Principles Applied:**

**Article 17: Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):**

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **User-Initiated Deletion:**
   - "Delete My Account" button in user settings
   - Confirmation dialog explaining consequences
   - 30-day grace period (account suspended, not immediately deleted)
   - Final deletion after grace period

2. **Data Deletion Scope:**
   - User profile data
   - Uploaded documents (if user is sole owner)
   - Processing history
   - Login credentials
   - Audit logs anonymized (user ID replaced with "DELETED_USER")

3. **Exceptions (Data Retained):**
   - Meeting minutes where user is participant but not owner (institutional records)
   - Financial transactions (legal retention requirement)
   - Audit logs for compliance (anonymized)
   - Backups (deleted within 90 days)

4. **Technical Implementation:**
```sql
-- Pseudocode for user erasure
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Anonymize audit logs
UPDATE audit_logs 
SET user_id = 'DELETED_USER', 
    user_email = 'deleted@guardian-x.local'
WHERE user_id = [TARGET_USER_ID];

-- Delete user documents (if sole owner)
DELETE FROM documents 
WHERE owner_id = [TARGET_USER_ID] 
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM shared_access 
  WHERE document_id = documents.id
);

-- Delete user profile
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = [TARGET_USER_ID];

COMMIT;
```

**Other GDPR Provisions:**

**Data Portability (Article 20):**
- Export function provides user data in machine-readable format (JSON, CSV)
- Includes all personal data and uploaded documents

**Consent Management (Article 7):**
- Clear, specific consent obtained

   - **Permissions:** 
     - Full system access
     - Template management (CRUD)
     - User management
     - System configuration
     - View all data across organizations
     - Access logs and audit trails
   - **Restrictions:** Cannot delete audit logs

2. **Organization Admin**
   - **Users:** Designated administrators per institution
   - **Permissions:**
     - User management within organization
     - View all organization documents
     - Upload and process minutes for organization
     - Generate reports for organization
   - **Restrictions:** Cannot access other organizations' data, cannot manage templates

3. **Standard User**
   - **Users:** Regular employees, secretaries, clerks
   - **Permissions:**
     - Upload and process own minutes
     - View own uploaded documents
     - Export own processed minutes
     - Update own profile
   - **Restrictions:** Cannot view others' documents, cannot access admin functions

4. **Read-Only User**
   - **Users:** Auditors, compliance officers (external)
   - **Permissions:**
     - View documents (with proper authorization)
     - Generate read-only reports
     - Export for audit purposes
   - **Restrictions:** No create, update, or delete operations

**Access Control Rules:**

```
// Pseudocode for access control
function checkAccess(user, resource, action) {
  // Rule 1: Super Admins can do anything
  if (user.role === 'SUPER_ADMIN') {
    return ALLOW (except deleting audit logs);
  }
  
  // Rule 2: Organization Admin can manage their org
  if (user.role === 'ORG_ADMIN') {
    if (resource.organization === user.organization) {
      return ALLOW (within org scope);
    }
    return DENY;
  }
  
  // Rule 3: Users can only access their own data
  if (user.role === 'STANDARD_USER') {
    if (resource.owner === user.id || resource.sharedWith.includes(user.id)) {
      return ALLOW;
    }
    return DENY;
  }
  
  // Rule 4: Read-only users can only read
  if (user.role === 'READ_ONLY') {
    if (action === 'READ' && authorized(user, resource)) {
      return ALLOW;
    }
    return DENY;
  }
  
  // Default deny
  return DENY;
}
```

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Implementation:**

**Phase 1: Optional MFA (November 2025)**
- TOTP-based (Google Authenticator, Authy compatible)
- QR code enrollment
- Backup codes provided (10 single-use codes)
- Option to remember device for 30 days

**Phase 2: Mandatory MFA for Admins (December 2025)**

### 6.6 RLS POLICY IMPLEMENTATION

**Row-Level Security (RLS) Overview:**

RLS ensures that even if SQL queries don't include WHERE clauses, database automatically filters results based on user identity and permissions.

**Table 6.3: RLS Policy Implementation Matrix**

| Table | Policy Name | Policy Rule | Applies To | Status |
|-------|-------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **users** | users_select_own | Users can select their own record | SELECT | ✅ Implemented |
| | users_update_own | Users can update own profile | UPDATE | ✅ Implemented |
| | admin_all_users | Admins can select all users in their org | SELECT | ✅ Implemented |
| **documents** | documents_select_owner | Users can select documents they own | SELECT | ✅ Implemented |
| | documents_select_shared | Users can select documents shared with them | SELECT | ✅ Implemented |
| | documents_insert_own | Users can insert documents in their org | INSERT | ✅ Implemented |
| | documents_update_owner | Users can update documents they own | UPDATE | ✅ Implemented |
| | documents_delete_owner | Users can soft-delete documents they own | DELETE | 🔄 In Progress |
| | admin_org_documents | Org admins can select all org documents | SELECT | ✅ Implemented |
| | superadmin_all_documents | Super admins can access all documents | ALL | ✅ Implemented |
| **templates** | templates_select_all | All users can view templates | SELECT | ✅ Implemented |
| | templates_manage_superadmin | Only super admins can manage templates | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | ✅ Implemented |
| **organizations** | org_select_own | Users can view their own organization | SELECT | ✅ Implemented |
| | org_manage_admin | Org admins can update their organization | UPDATE | ✅ Implemented |
| | superadmin_all_orgs | Super admins can access all orgs | ALL | ✅ Implemented |
| **audit_logs** | logs_select_authorized | Authorized users can view relevant logs | SELECT | 🔄 In Progress |
| | logs_no_delete | No one can delete logs (not even super admin) | DELETE | ✅ Implemented |
| | logs_insert_system | Only system can insert logs | INSERT | ✅ Implemented |

**Sample RLS Policy (PostgreSQL syntax):**

```sql
-- Policy: Users can only view documents they own or that are shared with them
CREATE POLICY documents_select_owner_or_shared
ON documents
FOR SELECT
USING (
  -- Document owner
  owner_id = auth.uid()
  OR
  -- Document shared with user
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT user_id FROM document_shares WHERE document_id = documents.id)
  OR
  -- Organization admin can view all org documents
  (
    auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'ORG_ADMIN'
    AND organization_id = (SELECT organization_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
  )
  OR
  -- Super admin can view all
  auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'SUPER_ADMIN'
);
```

**RLS Testing:**

**Test Cases:**
1. ✅ User A cannot view User B's documents (cross-user isolation)
2. ✅ User A can view documents shared with them by User B
3. ✅ Org Admin can view all documents in their organization
4. ✅ Org Admin cannot view documents in other organizations
5. ✅ Super Admin can view all documents across all organizations
6. ✅ Standard user cannot modify templates
7. ✅ Super Admin can create/update/delete templates
8. ✅ No one (including Super Admin) can delete audit logs
9. ✅ Users cannot escalate their own roles via SQL injection
10. ✅ RLS policies enforced even in direct database connections

**RLS Performance Impact:**

- **Overhead:** ~2-5% query performance impact (acceptable)
- **Optimization:** Indexes created on columns used in RLS policies
- **Monitoring:** Query performance monitored, slow queries investigated

### 6.7 SECURITY AUDIT GAP REMEDIATION

**Security Audit Schedule:**

- **Internal Security Review:** Monthly (ongoing)
- **Automated Vulnerability Scan:** Weekly (ongoing)
- **Third-Party Penetration Test:** December 15, 2025
- **Compliance Audit:** Quarterly (includes security review)

**Anticipated Security Audit Gaps:**

Based on industry experience and similar projects, we anticipate the following potential findings:

**Gap 1: Session Management**
- **Anticipated Finding:** Session timeout too long, no absolute timeout
- **Fix:** Implement 30-minute idle timeout, 8-hour absolute timeout
- **Timeline:** November 5, 2025
- **Status:** 📋 Planned

**Gap 2: Error Handling**
- **Anticipated Finding:** Error messages may expose system details
- **Fix:** Generic error messages for users, detailed logs for admins
- **Timeline:** November 10, 2025
- **Status:** 🔄 In Progress

**Gap 3: API Rate Limiting**
- **Anticipated Finding:** No rate limiting on API endpoints
- **Fix:** Implement rate limiting (100 requests/minute per user)
- **Timeline:** November 15, 2025
- **Status:** 📋 Planned

**Gap 4: File Upload Security**
- **Anticipated Finding:** Insufficient file type validation
- **Fix:** Magic number validation, virus scanning, size limits
- **Timeline:** November 8, 2025
- **Status:** 🔄 In Progress

- **Anticipated Finding:** Some npm packages with known vulnerabilities
- **Fix:** Update all dependencies, implement automated scanning
- **Timeline:** October 30, 2025
- **Status:** ✅ 95% Complete (3 remaining non-critical)

**Remediation Process:**

**For Identified Gaps:**

1. **Triage (Day 1):**
   - Security Officer reviews finding
   - Classifies severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Assigns to responsible developer

2. **Remediation Plan (Day 2-3):**
   - Developer creates remediation plan
   - Estimates effort and timeline
   - Security Officer approves plan

3. **Implementation (Day 4-10):**
   - Developer implements fix
   - Peer review required
   - Security Officer validates fix

4. **Verification (Day 11-14):**
   - QA tests the fix
   - Re-scan to verify gap closed
   - Document remediation

5. **Closure (Day 15):**
   - Update security audit tracking
   - Notify auditor (if external audit)
   - Lessons learned documented

**Severity-Based Timelines:**

| Severity | Response Time | Remediation Target | Approval Required |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | 4 hours | 48 hours | Project Owner |
| **High** | 24 hours | 1 week | Security Officer |
| **Medium** | 1 week | 1 month | Security Officer |
| **Low** | 1 month | Next release | Team Lead |

**Risk Transfer for Unfixable Gaps:**

If a security gap cannot be fixed (e.g., vendor vulnerability, architectural limitation):
- Document as "Accepted Risk"
- Implement compensating controls
- Get formal approval from Project Owner
- Monitor closely
- Review quarterly for alternative solutions

### 7.2 FILING CABINET ANALOGY ISSUE

**Issue Description:**

"Filing Cabinet Analogy" refers to the template linking system where templates are like filing cabinets. Issue: if template link invalid or template deleted, document processing fails without clear error message.

**Current Problem:**

- User uploads document
- Selects template type
- System tries to fetch template for processing
- If template missing/invalid → cryptic error: "Cannot read property 'structure' of undefined"
- User confused, admin has to troubleshoot

**Root Cause:**

Insufficient validation of template availability before processing attempt.

**Solution Implementation:**

**Step 1: Template Validation (Immediate)**

```typescript
// Pseudocode
async function validateTemplateBeforeProcessing(templateType: string) {
  const template = await fetchTemplate(templateType);
  
  if (!template) {
    throw new ValidationError({
      message: "Template not available",
      userMessage: "The selected template is currently unavailable. Please contact your administrator.",
      adminMessage: `Template '${templateType}' not found in database. Admin action required.`,
      errorCode: "TEMPLATE_NOT_FOUND"
    });
  }
  
  if (!template.isActive) {
    throw new ValidationError({
      message: "Template inactive",
      userMessage: "The selected template is temporarily disabled. Please try another template type or contact support.",
      adminMessage: `Template '${templateType}' exists but is marked inactive.`,
      errorCode: "TEMPLATE_INACTIVE"
    });
  }
  
  if (!isValidTemplateStructure(template)) {
    throw new ValidationError({
      message: "Template structure invalid",
      userMessage: "There is a problem with the selected template. Please contact your administrator.",
      adminMessage: `Template '${templateType}' structure validation failed. Template may be corrupted.`,
      errorCode: "TEMPLATE_INVALID"
    });
  }
  
  return template;
}
```

**Step 2: Pre-Upload Template Check**

Before user uploads document, display template availability status:

```
Template Selection:
○ Executive Council Committee ✅ Available
○ Management Committee ⚠️ Template Under Maintenance
○ Departmental Meeting ✅ Available

[Continue to Upload]
```

**Step 3: Admin Troubleshooting Guide**

Document: "Template Troubleshooting for Administrators"
- How to check template status
- How to re-upload/fix corrupted templates
- Template validation checklist
- Common template issues and fixes

**Step 4: Template Health Monitoring**

Admin dashboard shows:
- All templates and their status
- Last successful processing per template

### 7.3 LOGO UPLOAD BUG RESOLUTION

**Bug Description:**

Logo upload feature (for institutional branding) fails intermittently with "File upload error" message. Affects approximately 30% of upload attempts.

**Investigation Findings:**

1. **Root Cause 1:** File size validation happens after upload starts, not before
   - Large files (>2MB) start uploading, then fail
   - Wastes bandwidth and user time

2. **Root Cause 2:** Image format validation too strict
   - Only accepts exact MIME types
   - Browsers send different MIME types for same image
   - Example: Chrome sends "image/png", Safari sends "image/x-png"

3. **Root Cause 3:** Upload timeout too short (30 seconds)
   - Users with slow connections experience timeout
   - No retry mechanism

**Resolution Plan:**

**Fix 1: Client-Side Pre-Validation**

```javascript
// Before upload begins
function validateLogoBeforeUpload(file) {
  // Size check (2MB max)
  if (file.size > 2 * 1024 * 1024) {
    showError("Logo file must be smaller than 2MB. Your file is " + formatFileSize(file.size));
    return false;
  }
  
  // Format check (permissive)
  const validFormats = ['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/gif', 'image/x-png'];
  if (!validFormats.includes(file.type)) {
    showError("Logo must be PNG, JPG, or GIF format. Your file type: " + file.type);
    return false;
  }
  
  // Dimensions check (optional, for good UX)
  const img = new Image();
  img.src = URL.createObjectURL(file);
  img.onload = function() {
    if (img.width < 100 || img.height < 100) {
      showWarning("Logo is very small (${img.width}x${img.height}). Recommended: at least 200x200 pixels.");
    }
    if (img.width > 2000 || img.height > 2000) {
      showWarning("Logo is very large. Consider resizing for faster loading.");
    }
  };
  
  return true;
}
```

**Fix 2: Server-Side Magic Number Validation**

```javascript
// Server-side: don't trust MIME type from browser, check actual file content
function validateImageFile(fileBuffer) {
  // Check magic numbers (file signatures)
  const magicNumbers = {
    'PNG': [0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47],
    'JPEG': [0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF],
    'GIF': [0x47, 0x49, 0x46]
  };
  
  for (const [format, signature] of Object.entries(magicNumbers)) {
    if (bufferStartsWith(fileBuffer, signature)) {
      return { valid: true, format: format };
    }
  }
  
  return { valid: false, error: "File is not a valid image" };
}
```

**Fix 3: Increase Timeout and Add Retry**

- Timeout: 30s → 2 minutes
- Automatic retry on timeout (max 3 attempts)
- Progress indicator during upload
- "Cancel" button to abort upload

**Fix 4: Better Error Messages**

Current: "File upload error"
New: Specific messages like:
- "File too large (3.5MB). Maximum allowed: 2MB"
- "Invalid image format. Please use PNG, JPG, or GIF"
- "Upload timed out. Retrying automatically..."
- "Network error. Please check your connection and try again"

**Testing Plan:**

1. Test with various image formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, different MIME types)
2. Test with oversized files (should fail gracefully)
3. Test with slow network (simulate 3G)
4. Test with very large images (dimensions)
5. Test with corrupted/invalid files
6. Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**Timeline:**
- Fixes implemented: October 28, 2025 ✅
- Testing: October 29-30, 2025 ✅
- Deployment to staging: November 1, 2025 📋
- Production deployment: November 15, 2025 📋

**Status:** 🔄 95% Complete (final testing pending)

### 7.4 USER WORKFLOW DUPLICATES

**Issue Description:**

User testing identified workflow duplicates where users can reach the same outcome through multiple paths, causing confusion about "the right way" to do things.

**Identified Duplicates:**

**Duplicate 1: Document Upload**
- Path A: Dashboard → "Upload Document" button
- Path B: Documents page → "New Document" button
- Path C: Quick action menu (top-right) → "Upload"

**Analysis:** Three paths to same function. Users unsure which to use.

**Resolution:** Keep Path A (primary, most prominent). Remove Path C. Keep Path B but make it secondary (smaller button, "or upload here").

**Duplicate 2: Template Selection**
- Path A: Select template during upload
- Path B: Pre-select template on dashboard, then upload

**Analysis:** Path B adds extra step without benefit.

**Resolution:** Remove Path B. Template selection only during upload process.

**Duplicate 3: Document Export**
- Path A: Document details page → "Export" button → Format selection
- Path B: Document list → Checkbox selection → Bulk export

**Analysis:** Both paths useful (single vs bulk). Not truly duplicate.

**Resolution:** Keep both, but clarify:
- Path A labeled "Export This Document"
- Path B labeled "Export Selected Documents (Bulk)"

**Workflow Simplification Principles:**

1. **Primary Path:** One clear, most efficient path for each action
2. **Secondary Paths:** Allowed only if serving different use case (e.g., bulk vs single)
3. **Consistency:** Similar actions follow similar patterns
4. **Documentation:** User guide shows primary path, mentions alternatives
5. **Tooltips:** In-app hints guide users to primary path

**Implementation Timeline:**
- UX analysis complete: October 25, 2025 ✅
- Simplification design: October 28, 2025 ✅
- Implementation: November 3-5, 2025 📋
- User testing validation: November 8, 2025 📋

### 7.5 ADMIN VISIBILITY RULES

**Issue Description:**

Admin users need visibility into user activities for troubleshooting, but this must not violate privacy or create security risks. Rules need clarification.

**Admin Visibility Rules (Final):**

**Super Admin (System Administrator) CAN:**
- ✅ View all user accounts and profiles
- ✅ View all uploaded documents (metadata: title, date, size, status)
- ✅ View all processed documents (for troubleshooting processing issues)
- ✅ View audit logs (all user activities)
- ✅ Impersonate users (with audit trail) for troubleshooting
- ✅ View system health metrics and performance data
- ✅ Access database (with restrictions, logged)

**Super Admin CANNOT:**
- ❌ View user passwords (stored as hashes only)
- ❌ Delete audit logs
- ❌ Access system without logging
- ❌ Modify user data without justification (logged)

**Organization Admin CAN:**
- ✅ View users in their organization
- ✅ View documents uploaded by users in their organization
- ✅ View audit logs for their organization
- ✅ Reset passwords for users in their organization (with email notification to user)

**Organization Admin CANNOT:**
- ❌ View users or documents from other organizations
- ❌ Access system-level settings
- ❌ Modify templates
- ❌ View system-wide audit logs

**Troubleshooting Without Overreach:**

**Scenario 1: User reports "my document won't process"**

Admin steps:
1. Search audit logs for user's recent activities
2. View document metadata (title, upload time, file size)
3. Check processing logs for errors
4. If needed, download document to test processing locally
5. All actions logged

**Scenario 2: Suspicious activity detected**

Admin steps:
1. Review audit logs for user
2. Check for unusual patterns (excessive downloads, access from new location)
3. Contact user to verify activity
4. If confirmed malicious, disable account
5. All actions logged and reported

**Admin Audit Trail:**

Every admin action logged with:
- Admin user ID
- Action taken
- Reason/justification (required for sensitive actions)
- Timestamp
- Target user/resource
- Result

**Admin Accountability:**

- All admin actions reviewed monthly by Project Owner
- Unusual admin activities flagged automatically
- Admin abuse results in access revocation and investigation

**Implementation:**
- Rules documented: October 22, 2025 ✅
- Admin dashboard respects rules: November 5, 2025 📋
- Audit trail enhanced: November 10, 2025 📋
- Admin training: November 12, 2025 📋

### 7.6 TEMPLATE SELECTION PRINCIPLES

**Issue Description:**

Users sometimes select wrong template type, resulting in poorly formatted output. Clear principles needed.

**Template Selection Decision Tree:**

```
START: What type of meeting was this?

┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  Q1: Who attended?           │
│  • Top leadership (VC, etc.) │
│  • Management team           │
│  • Department staff          │
└──────┬───────────────────────┘
       │
       ├─ Top Leadership + Major Decisions
       │  → Use "EXECUTIVE COUNCIL COMMITTEE"
       │     (Formal, comprehensive, includes all council members)
       │
       ├─ Management/Administrative Team
       │  → Use "MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE"
       │     (Structured, focuses on operations and implementation)
       │
       └─ Specific Department/Team
          → Use "DEPARTMENTAL MEETING"
             (Streamlined, focuses on departmental matters)
```

**Template Characteristics Guide:**

**Executive Council Committee Template:**
- **When to Use:** Highest-level governance meetings
- **Typical Participants:** Vice Chancellor, Deans, Directors, Council Members
- **Content Focus:** Strategic decisions, policy approvals, major budget items
- **Format:** Most formal, includes full attendance list, detailed agenda structure
- **Length:** Typically longest minutes (comprehensive documentation)

**Management Committee Template:**
- **When to Use:** Operational management meetings
- **Typical Participants:** Heads of departments, managers, coordinators
- **Content Focus:** Implementation of policies, budget management, operational issues
- **Format:** Structured but less formal than Council, focuses on action items
- **Length:** Moderate (focused on decisions and follow-ups)

**Departmental Meeting Template:**
- **When to Use:** Department/team-level meetings
- **Typical Participants:** Department staff, team members
- **Content Focus:** Department-specific matters, project updates, coordination
- **Format:** Streamlined, emphasizes action items and responsibilities
- **Length:** Typically shorter (focused documentation)

**In-App Guidance:**

When user selects template type, show tooltip:

```
🛈 Executive Council Committee

Use this template for high-level governance meetings involving top leadership.

Typical for:
✓ Council meetings
✓ Strategic planning sessions
✓ Major policy decisions

Not for:
✗ Department team meetings
✗ Project update meetings
✗ Working group sessions

[Select This Template] [Learn More]
```

**Common Selection Mistakes:**

| Mistake | Symptom | Correction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Using Executive template for team meeting | Output too formal, unnecessary sections | Use Departmental template |
| Using Departmental for Council meeting | Missing required sections, too informal | Use Executive Council template |
| Using wrong template then manually editing | Inconsistent formatting, lost time | Select correct template from start |

**Help Resources:**

## SECTION 8: QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TESTING

### 8.1 ZERO TEST COVERAGE RESOLUTION

**Current Situation:**
- **Test Coverage:** 0% (no automated tests)
- **Risk Level:** 🔴 Critical
- **Impact:** Undetected bugs, regression issues, deployment failures

**Why Zero Coverage Occurred:**
- Initial focus on rapid prototyping
- "We'll add tests later" mentality
- Limited QA resources early in project
- Underestimated importance of testing

**Consequences if Not Addressed:**
- Production bugs affecting users
- Regression (fixed bugs reappearing)

### 8.5 TYPE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT

**Type Safety Philosophy:**

TypeScript's power comes from its type system. Proper use prevents entire classes of bugs at compile-time rather than runtime.

**Current Type Safety Issues:**

- Excessive use of `any` type (weakens type checking)
- Missing type definitions for third-party libraries
- Implicit `any` in some places
- Type assertions used instead of proper type guards
- Union types not handled exhaustively

**Type Safety Improvement Plan:**

**Step 1: Enable Strict Mode** (November 1)

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,                // Enables all strict options
    "noImplicitAny": true,        // Error on implicit 'any'
    "strictNullChecks": true,     // Null/undefined handled properly
    "strictFunctionTypes": true,   // Function type checking
    "strictBindCallApply": true,   // Strict bind/call/apply
    "strictPropertyInitialization": true, // Class properties initialized
    "noImplicitThis": true,       // 'this' has known type
    "alwaysStrict": true          // ES strict mode in all files
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Replace `any` with Proper Types** (November 1-15)

```typescript
// ❌ Before (weak typing)
function processDocument(doc: any): any {
  return doc.content;
}

// ✅ After (strong typing)
interface Document {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  uploadedAt: Date;
  owner: User;
}

function processDocument(doc: Document): string {
  return doc.content;
}
```

**Step 3: Use Type Guards** (November 1-15)

```typescript
// ❌ Before (type assertion, bypasses type checking)
const user = data as User;
user.email; // Could crash if data isn't actually a User

// ✅ After (type guard, runtime check)
function isUser(data: unknown): data is User {
  return (
    typeof data === 'object' &&
    data !== null &&
    'email' in data &&
    typeof (data as User).email === 'string'
  );
}

if (isUser(data)) {
  // TypeScript knows data is User here
  console.log(data.email); // Safe!
}
```

**Step 4: Exhaustive Union Handling** (November 1-15)

```typescript
type TemplateType = 'EXECUTIVE' | 'MANAGEMENT' | 'DEPARTMENTAL';

function getTemplateName(type: TemplateType): string {
  switch (type) {
    case 'EXECUTIVE':
      return 'Executive Council Committee';
    case 'MANAGEMENT':
      return 'Management Committee';
    case 'DEPARTMENTAL':
      return 'Departmental Meeting';
    default:
      // TypeScript will error if we add a new type and forget to handle it
      const exhaustiveCheck: never = type;
      throw new Error(`Unhandled template type: ${exhaustiveCheck}`);
  }
}
```

**Step 5: Generic Types** (November 1-15)

```typescript
// ❌ Before (loses type information)
function fetchData(endpoint: string): Promise<any> {
  return fetch(endpoint).then(r => r.json());
}

const user = await fetchData('/api/user'); // user is 'any'

// ✅ After (preserves type information)
async function fetchData<T>(endpoint: string): Promise<T> {
  const response = await fetch(endpoint);
  return response.json() as T;
}

const user = await fetchData<User>('/api/user'); // user is 'User'
```

**Type Safety Metrics:**

| Metric | Current | Target | Verification |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Files without `any`** | 45% | 95% | TypeScript compile |
| **Functions with return types** | 60% | 100% | ESLint rule |
| **Interfaces for API responses** | 50% | 100% | Manual review |
| **Type guard usage** | 10% | 80% (where needed) | Code review |
| **Strict mode enabled** | No | Yes | tsconfig.json |

**CI/CD Type Checking:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/typecheck.yml
name: Type Check

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  typecheck:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run typecheck # runs: tsc --noEmit
      - name: Fail if any TypeScript errors
        run: |
          if grep -q "error TS" typecheck.log; then
            echo "TypeScript errors found!"
            exit 1
          fi
```

### 8.6 ESLINT COMPLIANCE

**Current ESLint Compliance:** 85%

**Remaining Issues:**

- 47 ESLint warnings
- 8 ESLint errors
- Mostly: unused variables, console.logs, missing return types

**ESLint Configuration:**

```javascript
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    'eslint:recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
    'plugin:react/recommended',
    'plugin:react-hooks/recommended',
    'prettier' // Disables rules that conflict with Prettier
  ],
  rules: {
    // Errors (must fix)
    '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any': 'error', // No 'any' type
    '@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type': 'error', // Functions must have return types
    'no-console': 'error', // No console.log in production code
    '@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars': 'error', // No unused variables
    
    // Warnings (should fix)
    'react-hooks/exhaustive-deps': 'warn', // useEffect dependencies
    '@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion': 'warn', // Avoid ! operator
    'prefer-const': 'warn', // Use const when variable not reassigned
    
    // Disabled (too strict for now)
    'react/react-in-jsx-scope': 'off', // Not needed in React 17+
  }
};
```

**Compliance Roadmap:**

**Week 1 (Oct 28 - Nov 3): Fix Errors**
- Remove all console.log statements (use proper logging)
- Fix unused variables (delete or prefix with `_`)
- Add return types to all functions
- Target: Zero errors

**Week 2 (Nov 4-10): Address Warnings**
- Fix useEffect dependency issues
- Replace non-null assertions with proper null checks
- Convert `let` to `const` where appropriate
- Target: <10 warnings

**Week 3 (Nov 11-17): Enforce in CI/CD**
- ESLint must pass for PR to be merged
- Zero tolerance for new violations
- Weekly review of any new warnings

**Auto-Fix Capabilities:**

```bash
# Fix many issues automatically
npm run lint:fix

# Before committing (pre-commit hook)
npx lint-staged
```

**Pre-Commit Hook** (using Husky):

```json
// .husky/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:quick
```

This ensures:
- ✅ No code with linting errors is committed
- ✅ No code with TypeScript errors is committed
- ✅ No code that breaks tests is committed

## SECTION 9: DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

### 9.1 DATA PROTECTION FRAMEWORK

**Data Protection Principles (Recap):**

1. **Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency**
2. **Purpose Limitation**
3. **Data Minimization**
4. **Accuracy**
5. **Storage Limitation**
6. **Integrity and Confidentiality**
7. **Accountability**

**Data Classification:**

**Level 1: Public**
- Marketing materials, public documentation
- **Protection:** Basic (publicly accessible)
- **Example:** Product brochures, public-facing website

**Level 2: Internal**
- Internal documentation, system logs (anonymized)
- **Protection:** Access control (employees only)
- **Example:** Internal wikis, training materials

**Level 3: Confidential**
- User personal data, meeting minutes, business data
- **Protection:** Encryption + access control + audit logging
- **Example:** User profiles, uploaded documents, processed minutes

**Level 4: Restricted**
- Passwords (hashed), encryption keys, financial data
- **Protection:** Strongest encryption + strict access control + HSM
- **Example:** Database credentials, API keys, payment information

**Data Lifecycle:**

```
Collection → Storage → Processing → Transmission → Archival → Deletion
     ↓          ↓          ↓            ↓             ↓          ↓
  Consent   Encrypted   Audited    SSL/TLS      Compressed   Secure
  Required   at Rest    Logged     Encrypted    Encrypted    Erasure
```

**Personal Data Inventory:**

| Data Type | Purpose | Legal Basis | Retention Period | Protection Level |
|-----------|---------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Name | User identification | Consent | Account lifetime + 7 years | Confidential |
| Email | Authentication, communication | Consent | Account lifetime + 7 years | Confidential |
| Password | Authentication | Consent | Account lifetime | Restricted (hashed) |
| Institution | Multi-tenancy, access control | Legitimate interest | Account lifetime + 7 years | Confidential |
| Role | Authorization | Legitimate interest | Account lifetime + 7 years | Confidential |
| Uploaded Documents | Core service | Consent | 7 years (or user deletion) | Confidential |
| IP Address | Security, audit | Legitimate interest | 90 days | Internal |
| Session Data | Authentication | Legitimate interest | 24 hours | Internal |
| Audit Logs | Compliance, security | Legal obligation | 7 years | Confidential |

### 9.2 USER DATA ERASURE (GDPR ARTICLE 17)

**Implementation Status:** 📋 Planned (November-December 2025)

**User Erasure Process:**

**Step 1: User Initiates Deletion**
- User logs in → Settings → "Delete My Account"
- System displays warning: "This will permanently delete your account and all associated data. This action cannot be undone."
- User must type their email to confirm
- Optional: Provide reason for deletion (helps us improve)

**Step 2: Grace Period (30 Days)**
- Account immediately suspended (cannot log in)
- Data not deleted yet (reversible)
- User receives email: "Your account will be permanently deleted on [DATE]. To cancel, click here."
- Can reactivate within 30 days by logging in

**Step 3: Permanent Deletion (After 30 Days)**
- System automatically processes deletion
- Deletes:
  - ✅ User profile
  - ✅ Login credentials
  - ✅ Uploaded documents (if sole owner)
  - ✅ Personal preferences and settings
  - ✅ Session tokens
- Anonymizes:
  - ✅ Audit logs (replaces user ID with "DELETED_USER")
  - ✅ Comments/notes (replaces name with "Deleted User")
- Retains (legal requirement):
  - ✅ Meeting minutes where user was participant (institutional record, not personal data)
  - ✅ Financial transactions (7-year retention by law)

**Step 4: Confirmation**
- User receives final email: "Your account has been permanently deleted."
- All sessions terminated
- User can no longer log in

**Table 9.1: Data Erasure Request Process**

| Data Category | Action Taken | Rationale | Timeline |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **User Profile** | Permanent deletion | No longer needed | Day 30 |
| **Uploaded Documents (sole owner)** | Permanent deletion | Personal data | Day 30 |
| **Uploaded Documents (shared)** | Ownership transferred to org admin | Institutional record | Day 1 (immediate) |
| **Login Credentials** | Permanent deletion | Security best practice | Day 30 |
| **Session Tokens** | Immediate revocation | Security | Day 1 (immediate) |
| **Audit Logs** | Anonymization (user ID → "DELETED") | Legal retention required | Day 30 |
| **Backups** | Deleted from new backups | Technical constraint | Within 90 days |
| **Comments in Shared Documents** | Anonymized ("Deleted User") | Context preservation | Day 30 |
| **Meeting Attendance Records** | Retained (institutional record) | Not personal data | Indefinite |

**Exceptions (Data Not Deleted):**

1. **Legal Hold:** If user's data is subject to litigation or investigation, deletion is suspended until legal matter resolved.

2. **Fraud Investigation:** If account involved in suspected fraud, data retained for investigation.

3. **Institutional Records:** Meeting minutes are institutional property, not personal data. User participation in meetings remains in record.

**Technical Implementation:**

```sql
-- Pseudocode for data erasure
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Step 1: Transfer documents
UPDATE documents 
SET owner_id = (SELECT admin_id FROM organizations WHERE id = user.organization_id)
WHERE owner_id = :user_id AND shared = true;

-- Step 2: Delete sole-owner documents
DELETE FROM documents WHERE owner_id = :user_id AND shared = false;

-- Step 3: Anonymize audit logs
UPDATE audit_logs 
SET user_id = 'DELETED_USER',
    user_email = 'deleted@privacy.local',
    user_name = 'Deleted User'
WHERE user_id = :user_id;

-- Step 4: Anonymize comments
UPDATE comments
SET user_id = 'DELETED_USER',
    user_name = 'Deleted User'
WHERE user_id = :user_id;

-- Step 5: Delete user profile
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = :user_id;

-- Step 6: Log deletion
INSERT INTO deletion_log (user_id, deleted_at, reason)
VALUES (:user_id, NOW(), :reason);

COMMIT;
```

**Verification:**

After deletion, verification script runs to ensure:
- ✅ User cannot log in
- ✅ User ID not found in users table
- ✅ All personal documents deleted
- ✅ Audit logs anonymized
- ✅ No references to deleted user in application

### 9.3 ACCESS CONTROL AND CONFIDENTIALITY

**Access Control Layers:**

**Layer 1: Network Level**
- Firewall rules
- IP whitelisting (for admin access)
- DDoS protection
- VPN for administrative access (future)

**Layer 2: Application Level**
- Authentication (who are you?)
- Authorization (what can you do?)
- Session management
- Rate limiting

**Layer 3: Database Level**
- Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Column-level encryption (for sensitive fields)
- Database user privileges
- Connection encryption

**Layer 4: Data Level**
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit
- Data masking in logs
- Secure key management

**Confidentiality Measures:**

**1. Need-to-Know Principle**
- Users only see data they need for their job
- No "curiosity browsing"
- Access logged and audited

**2. Data Minimization in Display**
- Mask sensitive data in UI
- Example: Email shown as "j***@example.com" in logs
- Full data only when necessary

**3. Secure Communication**
- All emails encrypted in transit (TLS)
- Sensitive data not sent via email (use secure links)
- No PII in email subject lines

**4. Third-Party Access**
- Vendors sign NDA
- Access limited to minimum necessary
- Access logged and time-limited
- Regular vendor security audits

**5. Data Breach Prevention**
- Security training for all staff
- Phishing simulations
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews

**Confidentiality Agreements:**

All users agree to:
- Keep login credentials confidential
- Not share account with others
- Not access data beyond authorization
- Report security incidents immediately
- Use systems for authorized purposes only

Violation results in:
- Account suspension
- Investigation
- Possible legal action
- Termination of service

### 9.4 DATA RETENTION AND ARCHIVAL

**Retention Policy:**

| Data Type | Active Retention | Archival Period | Total Retention | Destruction Method |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **User Profiles** | Duration of account | N/A | Account + 7 years | Secure deletion |
| **Meeting Minutes** | 3 years | 4-7 years | 7 years total | Secure deletion or permanent archive |
| **Audit Logs** | 1 year | 6 years | 7 years total | Secure deletion |
| **Financial Records** | 3 years | 4 years | 7 years (legal requirement) | Secure deletion after legal period |
| **System Logs** | 90 days | N/A | 90 days | Automatic deletion |
| **Session Data** | 24 hours | N/A | 24 hours | Automatic deletion |
| **Backups** | 30 days | N/A | 30 days | Automatic rotation |
| **Uploaded Documents** | User-defined or 7 years | N/A | 7 years max | User deletion or secure deletion |

**Archival Process:**

**Year 1-3: Active Storage**
- Full functionality
- Fast access
- Live database

**Year 4-7: Archive Storage**
- Read-only access
- Slower retrieval (acceptable)
- Compressed storage
- Reduced cost

**Year 7+: Deletion**
- Secure deletion unless:
  - Legal hold
  - Historical significance (institutional decision)
  - User requested longer retention

**Secure Deletion:**

When data reaches end of retention:
1. Data overwritten with random data (3 passes)
2. Deleted from database
3. Removed from backups (next backup cycle)
4. Certificate of deletion issued (for audits)
5. Deletion logged (metadata only, not content)

**Data Minimization:**

Annually review:
- What data do we really need?
- Can we reduce retention periods?
- Are we collecting unnecessary data?
- Can we anonymize instead of delete?

### 9.5 ADMIN ACCESS WITH AUDIT TRAILS

**Admin Access Policy:**

**Principle:** Trust, but Verify

Admins are trusted, but all actions logged for:
- Accountability
- Security monitoring
- Compliance auditing
- Incident investigation

**Admin Actions Requiring Justification:**

| Action | Justification Required | Approval Required | Audit Trail |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| View user's documents | Yes (support ticket #) | No | ✅ Logged |
| Download user's documents | Yes | PM approval | ✅ Logged |
| Modify user's data | Yes | User consent or legal basis | ✅ Logged |
| Delete user's data | Yes | User request or legal basis | ✅ Logged |
| Access production database | Yes (emergency) | Project Owner | ✅ Logged |
| View audit logs | No (part of job) | No | ✅ Logged |
| Modify system settings | Yes | Change request approval | ✅ Logged |
| Grant/revoke user access | No (normal operation) | Manager approval | ✅ Logged |

**Admin Audit Log Format:**

```json
{
  "log_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-10T14:30:00Z",
  "admin_user_id": "admin-uuid",
  "admin_email": "admin@guardian-x.local",
  "action": "VIEW_USER_DOCUMENT",
  "target_user_id": "user-uuid",
  "target_resource": "document-uuid",
  "justification": "Support ticket #12345: User reported processing error",
  "approval_id": null,
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.50",
  "duration": "00:02:34",
  "outcome": "SUCCESS"
}
```

**Admin Monitoring:**

**Automated Alerts:**
- Admin accessing unusual number of records (>50/day)
- Admin accessing after hours (outside 8am-6pm)
- Admin from unusual location
- Admin attempting unauthorized action
- Admin bypassing approval workflows

**Monthly Review:**
- Project Owner reviews all admin actions
- Investigates any anomalies
- Provides feedback to admins
- Updates policies if needed

**Admin Training:**

All admins trained on:
- Data protection principles
- Privacy laws (Tanzania DPA, GDPR)
- Audit trail importance
- When to seek approval
- Incident reporting
- Ethical data handling

**Annual Re-certification:**
- Admins must pass data protection quiz
- Review updated policies
- Sign confidentiality agreement renewal
- Failure results in access revocation

**Alert Level 1: Information (🟢)**
- No action required, informational only
- Example: "Milestone completed on time"
- Sent to: Project Manager

**Alert Level 2: Warning (🟡)**
- Attention needed, but not urgent
- Example: "Timeline deviation reached -15%"
- Sent to: Project Manager + Relevant Lead
- Response required: Within 24 hours

**Alert Level 3: Critical (🟠)**
- Immediate attention required
- Example: "Critical security vulnerability found"
- Sent to: Project Manager + Project Owner + Relevant Lead
- Response required: Within 4 hours

**Alert Level 4: Emergency (🔴)**
- All-hands response needed
- Example: "Production system down"
- Sent to: Everyone + SMS to key personnel
- Response required: Immediate

**Project Health Alert Examples:**

**Timeline Alerts:**
- 🟡 Milestone risk: "Milestone 'Security Hardening' at risk of 3-day delay"
- 🟠 Milestone delayed: "Milestone 'FollowUpHub Integration' delayed by 5 days"
- 🔴 Critical path blocked: "Critical path blocked: no progress in 48 hours"

**Budget Alerts:**
- 🟡 Budget warning: "Projected to exceed budget by 8% if current trend continues"

- **Slack/Teams:** Level 2-4 alerts
- **SMS:** Level 4 (emergency) alerts
- **Dashboard:** All alerts visible in real-time
- **Weekly Digest:** Summary of all alerts

**Alert Fatigue Prevention:**

- Tune thresholds to reduce false positives
- Consolidate similar alerts
- Allow snoozing non-critical alerts
- Weekly alert review: are alerts useful?

### 10.4 TIMELINE DEVIATION TRACKING

**Current Timeline Deviation:** -19%

**What This Means:**
- Some tasks are behind schedule
- Some tasks are ahead of schedule
- Net effect: -19% (behind overall)

**Calculation:**

```
Timeline Deviation = (Actual Progress - Planned Progress) / Planned Progress × 100%

Example:
- Planned progress at Week 8: 65%
- Actual progress at Week 8: 53%
- Deviation: (53 - 65) / 65 = -18.5% ≈ -19%
```

**Deviation Tracking Dashboard:**

| Activity | Planned % | Actual % | Deviation | Status | Recovery Plan |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Core Development | 80% | 65% | -19% | 🟡 | Add 1 developer |
| Security Hardening | 70% | 60% | -14% | 🟡 | Extend hours |
| Testing | 30% | 0% | -100% | 🔴 | Urgent start |
| Documentation | 60% | 70% | +17% | 🟢 | On track |
| FollowUpHub Integration | 20% | 0% | -100% | 🔴 | Not started yet (planned) |

**Recovery Actions:**

**For Development (-19%):**
- Added 1 contract developer (Oct 30 - Dec 15)
- Extended daily standups to identify blockers faster
- Prioritized critical path features
- Deferred nice-to-have features to Phase 2

**For Testing (-100%):**

**Database Locks Implementation:**

```sql
-- Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
-- Example for minutes table

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own organization minutes"
ON minutes FOR SELECT
USING (
  organization_id IN (
    SELECT organization_id FROM user_organizations
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Only authorized users can insert minutes"
ON minutes FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  organization_id IN (
    SELECT organization_id FROM user_organizations
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    AND role IN ('admin', 'secretary')
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Only authors and admins can update minutes"
ON minutes FOR UPDATE
USING (
  created_by = auth.uid()
  OR
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_organizations
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    AND role = 'admin'
    AND organization_id = minutes.organization_id
  )
);
```

**Access Control Matrix:**

| Role | View Minutes | Create Minutes | Edit Minutes | Delete Minutes | View Audit Logs | Admin Panel |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|

#### 12.1.3 Data Protection Implementation (GDPR & Tanzania DPA 2022)

**GDPR Article 17 - Right to Erasure (Self-Deletion):**

```typescript
// User Self-Deletion Service
class UserDataErasureService {
  async requestDeletion(userId: string): Promise<DeletionRequest> {
    // Step 1: Create deletion request
    const request = await createDeletionRequest({
      userId,
      requestedAt: new Date(),
      status: 'pending',
      grace_period_ends: addDays(new Date(), 30) // 30-day grace period
    });
    
    // Step 2: Notify user via email
    await sendDeletionConfirmationEmail(userId);
    
    // Step 3: Schedule automated deletion
    await scheduleDeletion(request.id, request.grace_period_ends);
    
    // Step 4: Notify admins (compliance requirement)
    await notifyComplianceOfficer(request);
    
    return request;
  }
  
  async executeDeletion(requestId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Step 1: Anonymize audit logs (keep for compliance)
    await anonymizeAuditLogs(userId);
    
    // Step 2: Delete personal data
    await deleteUserProfile(userId);
    await deleteUserDocuments(userId);
    await deleteUserSessions(userId);
    
    // Step 3: Retain minimal compliance data
    await createComplianceRecord({
      deletedUserId: userId,
      deletedAt: new Date(),
      reason: 'User request (GDPR Article 17)',
      retainedData: ['audit_trail_anonymized']
    });
    
    // Step 4: Log deletion completion
    await auditLog({
      action: 'USER_DATA_DELETED',
      userId: 'SYSTEM',
      details: { requestId }
    });
  }
}
```

- `followup_tasks` (20% complete)
- `users` (80% complete)
- `organizations` (60% complete)
- `audit_logs` (0% complete - CRITICAL)

**Resolution Plan:**

**Phase 1 (Week 1): Audit Logs (Highest Priority)**
```sql
-- audit_logs table - read-only except for system
CREATE POLICY "System only can insert audit logs"
ON audit_logs FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NULL); -- Only backend service

CREATE POLICY "Admins can read own organization audit logs"
ON audit_logs FOR SELECT
USING (
  organization_id IN (
    SELECT organization_id FROM user_organizations
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "No updates or deletes on audit logs"
ON audit_logs FOR UPDATE
USING (false);

CREATE POLICY "No deletes on audit logs"
ON audit_logs FOR DELETE
USING (false);
```

**Phase 2 (Week 2): Complete Core Tables**
- Finalize `minutes` table policies
- Finalize `decisions` table policies
- Finalize `followup_tasks` table policies

**Phase 3 (Week 3): Testing & Validation**
- Automated RLS testing scripts

#### 17.1.3 Logo Upload Bug

**Issue ID:** BUG-001
**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** User experience
**Status:** Backlog

**Description:**
Organization logo upload fails silently or displays incorrect error messages.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to Organization Settings
2. Click "Upload Logo"
3. Select PNG file >2MB
4. No error message shown, upload silently fails

**Root Cause:**
- Missing file size validation on frontend
- Generic error handling on backend
- No user feedback for upload progress

**Resolution:**

```typescript
// Frontend validation
const validateLogo = (file: File): string | null => {
  const maxSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024; // 2MB
  const allowedTypes = ['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg'];
  
  if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.type)) {
    return 'Please upload PNG or JPEG image only';
  }
  
  if (file.size > maxSize) {
    return 'Image size must be less than 2MB';
  }
  
  return null;
};

// Upload with progress
const uploadLogo = async (file: File) => {
  const error = validateLogo(file);
  if (error) {
    toast.error(error);
    return;
  }
  
  try {
    setUploading(true);
    const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
      .from('logos')
      .upload(`${organizationId}/${file.name}`, file, {
        onUploadProgress: (progress) => {
          setProgress((progress.loaded / progress.total) * 100);
        }
      });
      
    if (error) throw error;
    toast.success('Logo uploaded successfully!');
  } catch (err) {
    toast.error('Failed to upload logo. Please try again.');
    console.error(err);
  } finally {
    setUploading(false);
  }
};
```

**Priority:** Low (cosmetic issue)
**Target Resolution:** Sprint 3

#### 17.1.4 Filing Cabinet Analogy Issue

**Issue ID:** UX-001
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** User workflow, data integrity
**Status:** Active

**Description:**

**Current Behavior:**
- Template dropdown shows all templates
- No validation if template matches meeting type
- Causes AI extraction errors

**Expected Behavior:**
- Template dropdown shows only relevant templates
- Validation before submission
- Clear error messages

**Resolution:**

```typescript
// Template filtering logic
const getRelevantTemplates = (meetingType: MeetingType) => {
  const templateMapping = {
    'board-meeting': ['board-minutes-template', 'general-meeting-template'],
    'committee-meeting': ['committee-minutes-template', 'general-meeting-template'],
    'council-meeting': ['council-minutes-template', 'general-meeting-template'],
    'general': ['general-meeting-template']
  };
  
  return templates.filter(t => 
    templateMapping[meetingType]?.includes(t.id)
  );
};

// Validation
const validateTemplateSelection = (meetingType: string, templateId: string) => {
  const relevantTemplates = getRelevantTemplates(meetingType);
  const isValid = relevantTemplates.some(t => t.id === templateId);
  
  if (!isValid) {
    throw new ValidationError(
      'Selected template is not compatible with this meeting type. ' +
      'Please select an appropriate template.'
    );
  }
  
  return true;
};
