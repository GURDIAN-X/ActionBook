 Duplicate decision IDs
 Missing required fields
 3. Performance Testing
 100 decisions synced simultaneously
 1000 tasks in system
 Concurrent updates from both systems
 4. Data Integrity Testing

 Layer 2: Detection
 Heartbeat monitoring (30-second intervals)
 Automated health checks
 Real-time error logging
 Alert system
 Layer 3: Response
 Automatic retry (exponential backoff)
 Fallback to queue system
 Manual sync trigger
 Incident escalation
 Layer 4: Recovery

Expected progress by Oct 22: 57%
 Actual progress: 42%
 Gap: 15 percentage points
 Days lost: ~14 days
 Recovery needed: 1.2x velocity
 Acceleration Actions:
 Immediate (Week 1-2):
 1. Add Resources
 Hire 1 contractor (backend focus)
 Budget: TZS 4,000,000/month
 Approval: Project Owner 
✅
 Approved
 2. Scope Prioritization
 Defer: Advanced analytics to Phase 2
 Defer: Mobile app polish
 Focus: Core task management, integration, notifications
 3. Extended Hours
 Team agreement for 10% overtime (max 4 hours/week)
 Compensation: Time-off after launch
 Duration: 4 weeks only
 4. Daily Integration Sync
 Joint MinuteHub-FollowUpHub standup
 Unblock integration issues immediately
 Time: 16:00 EAT (30 minutes)
 Short-term (Week 3-6):
 1. Parallel Work Streams
 Stream A: Task workflow completion
 Stream B: Notification system
 Stream C: Security hardening
 Stream D: Testing (starts week 4)
 2. Risk-Based Testing
Focus on critical paths
 Automated testing for non-critical
 Manual testing for integration
 3. Agile Adaptations
 Daily deployments to staging
 Continuous feedback loops
 Quick pivots on blockers
 Success Metrics:
 Sprint velocity: +25% by Sprint 3
 Timeline deviation: -5% by Nov 15
 Critical path items: 100% on track
 Team morale: >4.0/5.0 (monitored weekly)

SECTION 17: ISSUE TRACKING & RESOLUTION
 17.1 Current Critical Issues
 Issue FH-001: Integration Sync Delay
 Severity: Critical
 Impact: Tasks appear in FollowUpHub 3-5 seconds after decision created in MinuteHub
 Target: <1 second
 Status: Active
 Root Cause:
 Webhook delay from MinuteHub
 Sequential processing instead of parallel
 Database write bottleneck
 Resolution Plan:
 Week 1:
 Implement queue system (Redis)
 Parallel processing for non-dependent operations
 Database connection pooling optimization
 Week 2:
 WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
 Client-side optimistic UI updates
 Caching layer (Redis)
 Success Criteria:
 95% of syncs complete within 1 second
 No data loss
 Proper error handling
 Issue FH-002: Notification Delivery Inconsistency
 Severity: High
 Impact: Some users not receiving email notifications
 Status: Active
 Root Cause:
 Email service rate limiting
Missing retry logic
 Poor error handling
 Resolution:
